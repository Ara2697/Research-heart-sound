Paper-Inspired Code Implementations
**Implementation of Heart Sound Segmentation Algorithm Based on Heart Sound Envelogram**

---

The following is the description:

There is an updated version of the famous "Heart Sound Segmentation Algorithm Based on Heart Sound Envelogram" in this source. The paper is quite old, but the main ideas in it are still very useful for modern study. The code included here carefully adapts the main ideas explained in the paper to work in current computer systems. By going over these ideas again and putting them into action, we hope to make a useful tool for both students and writers.I have used samples from the two most richest heart sound databases, namely PhysioNet and the heartsound challenge. I captured peaks from the heart sound.  Subsequently, I used it for an alternative approach.
